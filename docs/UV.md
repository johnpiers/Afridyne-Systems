### The pip Interface

- uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

- uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides, platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and more.

- Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the `uv pip` interface.


!!! info "Platform-independent requirements."

    - Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:
    
    ```console
    $ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
       --universal \
       --output-file docs/requirements.txt
    Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
    ```

    ```console
    $ uv venv
    Using Python 3.12.3
    Creating virtual environment at: .venv
    Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    
    ---
    
    
    - Install the locked requirements:
    
    ```console
    $ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
    Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
    Installed 43 packages in 208ms

## FAQ

#### How do you pronounce uv?

It's pronounced as "you - vee" ([`/juː viː/`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English#Key))

#### How should I stylize uv?

Just "uv", please. See the [style guide](UV_Style/STYLE.md) for details.

## Acknowledgements

uv's dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We're grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for their support.

uv's Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv's optimizations are inspired by the great work we've seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun).  We've also learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith's [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its [trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline) for Windows support.
