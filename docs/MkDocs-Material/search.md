# Built-in Search Plugin

!!! version-added "Built-in Search Plugin"

    MaterialX `10.2.0` fully refactors the search module with a brand-new architecture, greatly improving **search quality** and **indexing efficiency**.
    
    It supports multi-provider mode, chunked indexing, on-demand loading, index compression, multilingual search and cross-domain search. It is suitable for various complex scenarios and large-scale sites, and can handle sites with more than 100,000 pages.
    
    [Pagefind]{target="_blank"} is the default provider. You may switch back to the original [Lunr]{target="_blank"} when using it in an [offline]{target="_blank"} environment (opened via the `file://` protocol).
    
  [Pagefind]: https://pagefind.app/
  [Lunr]: https://lunrjs.com/
  [offline]: offline.md
  
## Objective

### How it works

!!! instruction "How it works!"

    The plugin builds the selected provider's index after MkDocs has rendered the site. The frontend loads that provider through a common integration and renders the results with MaterialX's built-in search interface.
    
    Pagefind scans the generated HTML and writes a chunked index beside the site. At search time, the browser loads only the chunks and result data needed for the current query. Lunr writes `search_index.json`, then constructs and queries its in-memory index in a Web Worker.
    
## Configuration

!!! recommendation "Configuration"
    The search plugin is built into MaterialX and doesn't need to be installed. Add [***search***{.bright-large}] to the ***`plugins`***{.bright-large} list to enable it (pagefind is the default provider):
    
    ``` yaml
    plugins:
      - search
    ```
    
  [***search***{.bright-large}]: https://jaywhj.github.io/mkdocs-materialx/plugins/search.html#built-in-search-plugin

### Configuration structure

The example below demonstrates the provider-based structure and available options, **all of which are optional**.


``` yaml
plugins:
  - search:
      provider: pagefind # pagefind (default) or lunr

      pagefind:
        # Index configuration
        include_characters: ._
        keep_index_url: true
        exclude_selectors:
          - .md-banner
        # output_subdir: search
        # logfile: pagefind.log

        # Browser Search API configuration
        options:
          excerptLength: 30
          exactDiacritics: false
          ranking:
            termFrequency: 1.0
            termSimilarity: 1.0
            pageLength: 0.75
            termSaturation: 1.4
            diacriticSimilarity: 0.8
            metaWeights:
              title: 5.0

      lunr:
        lang:
          - en
        separator: '[\s\-]+'
        pipeline:
          - stemmer
          - stopWordFilter
          - trimmer
        # jieba_dict: dict.txt
        # jieba_dict_user: user_dict.txt
```

### Provider

!!! desc "Provider"

    Use this setting to select the search provider:

    === "Pagefind"

        ``` yaml
        plugins:
          - search:
              provider: pagefind
        ```

    === "Lunr"

        ``` yaml
        plugins:
          - search:
              provider: lunr
        ```

    [Pagefind]{target="_blank"} is the default provider. You may switch back to the original [Lunr]{target="_blank"} when using it in an [offline]{target="_blank"} environment (opened via the `file://` protocol).


## Pagefind

!!! desc "Pagefind"

    Pagefind is a static search library designed around a small initial payload and on-demand index loading. MaterialX integrates `pagefind[extended]` with specific support for Chinese and Japanese.


### Features

!!! desc "Features"

    - **High-quality search results**: It matches keywords comprehensively by combining multiple metrics including term similarity, term saturation, term frequency, page length, diacritics, as well as weights for content and metadata, delivering more accurate and comprehensive search results

    - **High performance for large sites**: It implements chunked indexing and on-demand loading mechanisms. Regardless of the total number of pages on the site, only index chunks relevant to search keywords are loaded into memory instead of the entire index, which greatly boosts search performance

    - **Multilingual search**: It automatically detects page languages and generates corresponding chunked indexes for all supported languages

    - **Cross-domain multi-site search**: It can be configured to search across multiple sites and merge results and filters into a single response


### Index configuration

Configure indexing options directly under the `pagefind` level:

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `exclude_selectors` | `nav`, `footer` | CSS selectors and their descendants to omit from indexing |
| `include_characters` | `._` | Punctuation preserved as searchable characters |
| `keep_index_url` | `true` | Keep `index.html` at the end of result URLs |
| `logfile` | none | Also write logs to a file; relative paths are resolved inside `output_subdir` |
| `options` | `{}` | Browser Search API configuration, described in the next section |

!!! desc ""
    MaterialX marks the main content with `data-pagefind-body` and manages the index input, output, and result URL format. Other Pagefind index options remain available for advanced use, see Pagefind's [index configuration]{target="_blank"}.
    
  [index configuration]: https://pagefind.app/docs/config-options/

### Search API configuration

Configure the browser Search API options directly under the `pagefind.options` level:

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `excerptLength` | `30` | Maximum target length for generated result excerpts |
| `exactDiacritics` | `false` | Treat accented and unaccented characters as distinct |
| `ranking` | Pagefind defaults | Tune result ranking with the parameters below |

!!! desc ""
    MaterialX manages bundle routing, result URLs, and highlighting. The complete upstream option set remains available for special cases in Pagefind's [Search API configuration]{target="_blank"}.
    
The options for `ranking` are as follows:

| Ranking option | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `termFrequency` | `1.0` | Balance term frequency against weighted term count |
| `termSimilarity` | `1.0` | Prefer indexed terms whose length is closer to the query |
| `pageLength` | `0.75` | Control how strongly shorter-than-average pages are favored |
| `termSaturation` | `1.4` | Control how quickly repeated terms stop increasing relevance |
| `diacriticSimilarity` | `0.8` | Boost exact diacritic matches when normalization is enabled |
| `metaWeights` | `title: 5.0` | Weight matches in title or custom metadata fields |

For value ranges and the remaining controls, see Pagefind's [ranking documentation]{target="_blank"}.

### Excluding Content

#### Excluding an Entire Page

!!! desc "Excluding an Entire Page"

    Use `search.exclude` in the Markdown front matter to remove a complete page and all of its sections from the Pagefind index:

    ``` yaml
    ---
    search:
      exclude: true
    ---

    # Page title
    ...
    ```

!!! desc "Meta Plugin"

    The [meta] plugin can apply the same property to every page in a folder:

    ``` yaml title=".meta.yml"
    search:
      exclude: true
    ```

  [meta]: meta.md


#### Excluding certain types of elements

!!! desc "Excluding certain types of elements"

    Use `exclude_selectors` for elements that should be ignored throughout the site, such as a custom banner or generated utility block:

    ``` yaml
    plugins:
      - search:
          pagefind:
            exclude_selectors:
              - .md-banner
              - .generated-example
    ```

    The matched element and all of its children are excluded.

#### Excluding part of a page

!!! desc "Excluding part of a page"

    Use Pagefind's `data-pagefind-ignore` attribute to exclude part of a document. For a complete section, wrap the heading and its content in an HTML container:

    ``` html
    <div data-pagefind-ignore markdown>

    ## Internal notes

    This complete section is excluded from Pagefind.

    </div>
    ```


  [Attribute Lists]: python-markdown.md#attribute-lists

### Other Pagefind Features

!!! desc "Other Pagefind Features"

    Pagefind also supports metadata, filters, sorting, content weighting, custom records, and search across multiple sites. These are upstream Pagefind capabilities; some require custom templates, indexing code, or frontend code beyond MaterialX's built-in integration. See the [Pagefind]{target="_blank"} documentation and [multisite search]{target="_blank"} guide for the complete workflows.
    
  [multisite search]:https://pagefind.app/docs/multisite/

## Lunr

!!! desc "Lunr"
    Lunr builds one JSON search index and loads it into a Web Worker in the browser. It is less efficient for very large sites than Pagefind, but remains the right provider when a generated site must work without an HTTP server.
    
### Language

!!! desc "Setting config.lang"

    Use this setting to specify the language of the search index, enabling [stemming] support for languages other than English. The default is computed from the [site language], but can be set to one or multiple languages:

    === "Set language"

        ``` yaml
        plugins:
          - search:
              provider: lunr
              lunr:
                lang: en
        ```

    === "Add further languages"

        ``` yaml
        plugins:
          - search:
              provider: lunr
              lunr:
                lang: # (1)!
                  - en
                  - de
        ```

        1.  Including more languages increases the base JavaScript payload by around 20kb and by another 15-30kb per language, all before
         `gzip`.

  [site language]: changing-the-language.md#site-language
  [lunr languages]: https://github.com/MihaiValentin/lunr-languages

!!! desc "Language Support"

    Language support is provided by [lunr languages], a collection of language-specific stemmers and stop words for Lunr maintained by the Open Source community.

    ??? education "Languages"

        The following languages are currently supported by [lunr languages]:

        <div class="mdx-columns" markdown>

        - `ar` – Arabic
        - `da` – Danish
        - `de` – German
        - `du` – Dutch
        - `en` – English
        - `es` – Spanish
        - `fi` – Finnish
        - `fr` – French
        - `hi` – Hindi
        - `hu` – Hungarian
        - `hy` – Armenian
        - `it` – Italian
        - `ja` – Japanese
        - `kn` – Kannada
        - `ko` – Korean
        - `no` – Norwegian
        - `pt` – Portuguese
        - `ro` – Romanian
        - `ru` – Russian
        - `sa` – Sanskrit
        - `sv` – Swedish
        - `ta` – Tamil
        - `te` – Telugu
        - `th` – Thai
        - `tr` – Turkish
        - `vi` – Vietnamese
        - `zh` – Chinese

        </div>

    If [lunr languages] doesn't support the selected [site language], the plugin falls back to the language that is expected to yield the best stemming results.


### Tokenization

!!! desc "Tokenization"

    Use this setting to specify the separator used to split words when building the search index. The default is computed from the [site language], but can be set explicitly:

    ``` yaml
    plugins:
      - search:
          provider: lunr
          lunr:
            separator: '[\s\-,:!=\[\]()"/]+|(?!\b)(?=[A-Z][a-z])|\.(?!\d)|&[lg]t;'
    ```

    Separators support [positive and negative lookahead assertions], allowing precise control over how words are split.

    Broken into its parts, this separator induces the following behavior:

    === "Special characters"

        ```
        [\s\-,:!=\[\]()"/]+
        ```

        This inserts token boundaries before and after whitespace, hyphens, commas, brackets, and other special characters. Adjacent separators are treated as one.

    === "Case changes"

        ```
        (?!\b)(?=[A-Z][a-z])
        ```

        This splits programming identifiers at case changes, tokenizing
        `PascalCase` into `Pascal` and `Case`.

    === "Version strings"

        ```
        \.(?!\d)
        ```

        The negative lookahead prevents version strings like `1.2.3` from being split into separate numbers and keeps them discoverable.

    === "HTML/XML tags"

        ```
        &[lg]t;
        ```

        This accounts for `<` and `>` being encoded as `&lt;` and `&gt;` in code
        blocks, allowing users to search for tag names.


  [positive and negative lookahead assertions]: https://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html

### Pipeline

!!! desc "Pipeline"

    Use this setting to specify the [pipeline functions] that filter and expand tokens after tokenization and before adding them to the index. The default is computed from the [site language]:

    ``` yaml
    plugins:
      - search:
          provider: lunr
          lunr:
            pipeline:
              - stemmer
              - stopWordFilter
              - trimmer
    ```

    The following pipeline functions can be used:

    - `stemmer` – Stem tokens to their root form, e.g. `running` to `run`
    - `stopWordFilter` – Filter common words such as `a` and `the`
    - `trimmer` – Trim whitespace from tokens


  [pipeline functions]: https://lunrjs.com/guides/customising.html#pipeline-functions

### Segmentation

!!! desc "Segmentation"

    The plugin supports Chinese text segmentation with [jieba](https://pypi.org/project/jieba/). Japanese and Korean are segmented on the client side when Lunr is selected.

    Use this setting to specify a [custom dictionary] for [jieba](https://pypi.org/project/jieba/), replacing its default dictionary:

    ``` yaml
    plugins:
      - search:
          provider: lunr
          lunr:
            jieba_dict: dict.txt
    ```

    The following dictionaries are provided by [jieba]:

    - [dict.txt.small] – 占用内存较小的词典文件
    - [dict.txt.big] – 支持繁体分词更好的词典文件

    The path is resolved from the project root directory.


  [custom dictionary]: https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba#%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96%E8%AF%8D%E5%85%B8
  [dict.txt.small]: https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba/raw/master/extra_dict/dict.txt.small
  [dict.txt.big]: https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba/raw/master/extra_dict/dict.txt.big


!!! desc "Add User Dictionary to [jieba](https://pypi.org/project/jieba/)"

    Use this setting to add a [user dictionary] to [jieba](https://pypi.org/project/jieba/) without replacing the default dictionary. User dictionaries are useful for product names, technical terms, and other site-specific vocabulary:

    ``` yaml
    plugins:
      - search:
          provider: lunr
          lunr:
            jieba_dict_user: user_dict.txt
    ```

    The path is resolved from the project root directory.


  [user dictionary]: https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba#%E8%BD%BD%E5%85%A5%E8%AF%8D%E5%85%B8

### Excluding sections and blocks

!!! desc "Excluding sections and blocks"

    When [Attribute Lists] is enabled, a section can be excluded from the Lunr index by adding `data-search-exclude` to its heading. The heading and all content up to the next heading of the same or higher level are omitted:

    ``` markdown
    # Page title

    ## Public section

    This content is included.

    ## Internal section { data-search-exclude }

    This complete section is excluded from Lunr.
    ```

    Add the same attribute after an inline or block-level element to exclude only that element:

    ``` markdown
    This paragraph is included.

    This paragraph is excluded.
    { data-search-exclude }
    ```


### Metadata

!!! desc "Metadata"

    Use this property to increase or decrease the relevance of a page in Lunr results. Values above `1` rank a page up and values below `1` rank it down:

    === ":material-arrow-up-circle: Rank up"

        ``` yaml
        ---
        search:
          boost: 2 # (1)!
        ---

        # Page title
        ...
        ```

        1.  When boosting pages, always start with low values.

    === ":material-arrow-down-circle: Rank down"

        ``` yaml
        ---
        search:
          boost: 0.5
        ---

        # Page title
        ...
        ```

    Use this property to exclude a page and all of its subsections from the Lunr index. The Pagefind provider recognizes the same property:

    ``` yaml
    ---
    search:
      exclude: true
    ---

    # Page title
    ...
    ```
