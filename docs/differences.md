# MaterialX

**MaterialX**, the next generation of mkdocs-material, build beautiful sites the way you already know and love, based on `mkdocs-material-9.7.1` and named `X`, it provides ongoing maintenance and updates.

??? desc "Why MaterialX ?"

    The MkDocs project is nearing its end due to personal issues involving its original author. He has ceased updates for MkDocs and intends to release a completely new 2.0 version as a replacement. However, this new version is entirely incompatible with the existing ecosystem. It is an entirely separate project that merely carries the MkDocs name, and an accidental upgrade will result in devastating damage.

    As a result, to break free from dependency on MkDocs, the team behind the popular mkdocs-material theme framework has discontinued its maintenance and shifted to developing an entirely new alternative project named Zensical. While it adopts a new architecture and eliminates dependency on MkDocs, it still lacks many features. In addition, it is incompatible with the existing MkDocs ecosystem, making many existing plugins unavailable. This imposes certain migration costs on users, and its stability remains unproven.

    To ensure the continued stable operation of existing MkDocs projects and ecosystem, a new community-driven successor to MkDocs has emerged: ProperDocs (based on MkDocs 1.6.1). It will provide ongoing updates and maintenance while remaining fully compatible with the original MkDocs ecosystem.

    Similarly, mkdocs-material also has a new successor: **MaterialX** (based on mkdocs-material 9.7.1). It provides ongoing maintenance and updates, with full compatibility with the original ecosystem and zero migration costs.

In short: **`MaterialX + ProperDocs`** is an equivalent replacement for `mkdocs-material + mkdocs` and provides ongoing maintenance and updates.

**MaterialX** preserves the **rich features** and **stability** of the mkdocs-material project, while delivering **new features** and **broad compatibility**, and will adopt the following brand-new vision and positioning.

## Roadmap

MaterialX aims to be a **simple, zero-fuss** static site generator.

Users can convert their regular notes and docs into professional sites with just light configuration, for easy sharing and communication.

??? desc "Why the focus on simplicity and ease of use ?"

    In my opinion, the beauty of technology lies in enabling more people to effortlessly achieve what was once difficult using the tools you provide.

    A great product should strike the perfect balance in feature design, knowing when to stop, instead of overwhelming users with excessive feature options and dazzling configuration items. Let’s be honest, both mkdocs-material and Zensical suffer from over-customization, burdened with overly complex configurations. Who doesn’t end up with hundreds of lines of config? Who hasn’t spent days tinkering with mkdocs-material on their first try?

Therefore, MaterialX will adhere to the following goals and principles:

- **Goal**: Pursue **accessibility for everyone**. Empowering all users to own their websites, including but not limited to developers, product managers, marketers, and DevOps engineers. Website creation should no longer be exclusive to technical users
- **Principle**: **Extreme ease of use** is the top priority. MaterialX will simplify configurations and feature sets, provide sensible defaults and automated setup, and minimize the cost of configuration and usage for users
- **Focus**: **General-purpose features** and **visual presentation**. Future feature choices will focus more on general-purpose features and visual presentation, and it will deliver a wider range of content presentation formats, such as graphs, charts, images, audio and video, to bring your content to life
- **Obsession**: **User experience (UX)**. It will pay meticulous attention to interactive and visual details, whether it’s an unnoticeable line spacing adjustment or a simple border design ...

## Update Highlights

- Added Markdown source support for **AI agents** to provide structured content, reducing token consumption by over 80%
- Refactored the search module with a brand-new architecture, greatly improving **search quality** and **indexing efficiency**. It supports multi-provider mode, chunked indexing, on-demand loading, index compression, multilingual search and cross-domain search. It is suitable for various complex scenarios and large-scale sites, and can handle sites with more than 100,000 pages, see [Search](MkDocs-Material/search.md){target="_blank"}
- Added code block download & **auto-collapse/expand** long code blocks features, see [Code blocks](MkDocs-Material/code-blocks.md#code-collapse-expand){target="_blank"}
- Added the new **Steps** component for clearer, more intuitive display of procedures and workflows, see [Steps](steps.md){target="_blank"}
- Enhanced `blog` and support for CJK languages
- Added next-generation date & author plugin, see: [Date and Authors](MkDocs-Material/adding-document-dates-authors.md){target="_blank"}
    - It's **20-500 times faster** than `git-revision-date-localized` and `git-authors`, and works in any environment (no-Git, Git environments, Docker, all CI/CD build systems, etc.)
    - Completely resolved date and time infrastructure issues, enabling the project to support automated date processing. **Manual date configuration is no longer required for any feature**, including: page date display, blog post dates, blog date archives, blog list sorting, sitemap.xml (lastmod - SEO improvements), RSS feeds, recently updated section, search ranking, and more
- Added Recent Updated module, see: [Recently updated](adding-recent-updates-module.md){target="_blank"}
    - Automatically generates document summaries (no manual configuration needed)
    - Intelligently estimates reading time, supporting all languages (CJK languages + Space-delimited languages)
- Refactored the mobile TOC component for seamless NAV and TOC experience on mobile (**better interactive experience**)
- Perfectly fixed the issue where swipe gestures would penetrate when the sidebar drawer was active on mobile (prone to accidental operations and poor user experience; unresolved in Zensical and Material)
- Significantly polished the UX and details on mobile devices
    - Moved the "Back to top" container to the bottom, aligning with natural interaction logic
    - Optimized the show/hide sensitivity of the "Back to top" container
    - Added indent guide lines and active link accent colors for the TOC
- Added the modern Liquid Glass theme, allows setting the topbar background color in this theme to support backgrounds with different color schemes, see [Topbar style](MkDocs-Material/changing-the-colors.md#topbar-style){target="_blank"}

## Quick Start

<div class="steps" markdown>

1. Installation:

``` sh
pip install mkdocs-materialx
```

2. Configure `materialx` theme to mkdocs.yml:

``` yaml
theme:
  name: materialx
```

!!! note

    - The theme name is `materialx`, not material. Everything else is the same as when using material.
    - To lower the barrier for users, MaterialX is designed to share the same package name with `mkdocs-material`, you may treat MaterialX and `mkdocs-material` as different versions of the same project, only one version can be installed in a single environment, and the later‑installed package will overwrite the earlier one. Since `mkdocs-material` will soon be deprecated, coexistence was not considered.

3. Start a live preview server with the following command for automatic open and reload:

=== "MkDocs"

    ```
    mkdocs serve --livereload -o
    ```

=== "ProperDocs"

    ```
    properdocs serve -o
    ```
</div>
