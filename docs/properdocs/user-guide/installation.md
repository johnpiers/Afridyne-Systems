# ProperDocs Installation

A detailed guide.

---

## Requirements

ProperDocs requires a recent version of [Python] and the Python package
manager, [pip], to be installed on your system.

You can check if you already have these installed from the command line:

```console
$ python --version
Python 3.8.2
$ pip --version
pip 20.0.2 from /usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pip (python 3.8)
```

If you already have those packages installed, you may skip down to [Installing
ProperDocs](#installing-properdocs).

### Installing Python

Install [Python] using your package manager of choice, or by downloading an
installer appropriate for your system from [python.org] and running it.

> NOTE:
> If you are installing Python on Windows, be sure to check the box to have
> Python added to your PATH if the installer offers such an option (it's
> normally off by default).
>

### Installing pip

If you're using a recent version of Python, the Python package manager, [pip],
is most likely installed by default. However, you may need to upgrade pip to the
lasted version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

If you need to install pip for the first time, download [get-pip.py].
Then run the following command to install it:

```bash
python get-pip.py
```

## Installing ProperDocs

Install the `properdocs` package using pip:

```bash
pip install properdocs
```

You should now have the `properdocs` command installed on your system. Run `properdocs
--version` to check that everything worked okay.

```console
$ properdocs --version
properdocs, version 1.2.0 from /usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/properdocs (Python 3.8)
```

> NOTE:
> If you are using Windows, some of the above commands may not work
> out-of-the-box.
>
> A quick solution may be to preface every Python command with `py -m`
> like this:
>
> ```bash
> py -m pip install properdocs
> py -m properdocs
> ```
>
> See information about the [Python Launcher for Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#basic-use).
>
> Or you may need to edit your `PATH` environment
> variable to include the `Scripts` directory of your Python installation.
> Recent versions of Python include a script to do this for you.
