# Contributing to ProperDocs

An introduction to contributing to the ProperDocs project.

The ProperDocs project welcomes contributions from developers and
users in the open source community. Contributions can be made in a number of
ways, a few examples are:

* Code patches via pull requests
* Documentation improvements
* Bug reports and patch reviews

For information about available communication channels please refer to the
[README](https://github.com/properdocs/properdocs#readme) file in our
GitHub repository.

## Reporting an Issue

Please include as much detail as you can. Let us know your platform and ProperDocs
version. If the problem is visual (for example a theme or design issue), please
add a screenshot. If you get an error, please include the full error message and
traceback.

It is particularly helpful if an issue report touches on all of these aspects:

1.  What are you trying to achieve?

2.  What is your `properdocs.yml` configuration (+ other relevant files)? Preferably reduced to the minimal reproducible example.

3.  What did you expect to happen when applying this setup?

4.  What happened instead and how didn't it match your expectation?

## Trying out the Development Version

If you want to just install and try out the latest development version of
ProperDocs (in case it already contains a fix for your issue),
you can do so with the following command. This can be useful if you
want to provide feedback for a new feature or want to confirm if a bug you
have encountered is fixed in the git master. It is **strongly** recommended
that you do this within a [virtualenv].

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/properdocs/properdocs.git
```

## Installing for Development

Note that for development you can just use [Hatch] directly as described below. If you wish to install a local clone of ProperDocs anyway, you can run `pip install --editable .`. It is **strongly** recommended that you do this within a [virtualenv].

## Installing Hatch

The main tool that is used for development is [Hatch]. It manages dependencies (in a virtualenv that is created on the fly) and is also the command runner.

So first, [install it](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/#pip). Ideally in an isolated way with **`pipx install hatch`** (after [installing `pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/)), or just `pip install hatch` as a more well-known way.

## Running all checks

To run **all** checks that are required for ProperDocs, just run the following command in the cloned ProperDocs repository:

```bash
hatch run all
```

**This will encompass all of the checks mentioned below.**

All checks need to pass. If you make a pull request, [GitHub Actions] will also validate that all checks are passing.

### Running tests

To run the test suite for ProperDocs, run the following commands:

```bash
hatch run test:test
hatch run integration:test
```

It will attempt to run the tests against all of the Python versions we support.

### Python code style

Python code within ProperDocs' code base is formatted using [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), and all style settings are configured near the bottom of [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/ProperDocs/properdocs/blob/master/pyproject.toml).

You can automatically check and format the code according to these tools with the following command:

```bash
hatch run style:fix
```

The code is also type-checked using [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) - also configured in [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/ProperDocs/properdocs/blob/master/pyproject.toml), it can be run like this:

```bash
hatch run types:check
```

### Other style checks

There are several other checks, such as spelling and JS style. To run all of them, use this command:

```bash
hatch run lint:check
```

### Documentation of ProperDocs itself

After making edits to files under the `docs/` dir, you can preview the site locally using the following command:

```bash
hatch run docs:serve
```

Note that any 'WARNING' should be resolved before submitting a contribution. This is also validated by GitHub Actions.

Documentation files are also checked by markdownlint, so you should run this as well:

```bash
hatch run lint:check
```

If you add a new plugin to properdocs.yml, you don't need to add it to any "requirements" file, because that is managed automatically via [hatch-properdocs](https://github.com/ProperDocs/hatch-properdocs).

> INFO: If you don't want to use Hatch, for documentation you can install requirements into a virtualenv, in **one of** these ways (with `.venv` being the virtualenv directory):
>
> *   Exact versions of dependencies:
>
>     ```bash
>     .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements/requirements-docs.txt
>     ```
>
> *   Latest versions of all dependencies:
>
>     ```bash
>     .venv/bin/pip install -r $(properdocs get-deps)
>     ```

## Translating themes

To localize a theme to your favorite language, follow the guide on [Translating Themes]. We welcome translation pull requests!

## Submitting Pull Requests

If you're considering a large code contribution to ProperDocs, please prefer to
open an issue first to get early feedback on the idea.

Once you think the code is ready to be reviewed, push
it to your fork and send a pull request. For a change to be accepted it will
most likely need to have tests and documentation if it is a new feature.

When working with a pull request branch:  
Unless otherwise agreed, prefer `commit` over `amend`, and `merge` over `rebase`. Avoid force-pushes, otherwise review history is much harder to navigate. For the end result, the "unclean" history is fine because most pull requests are squash-merged on GitHub.

Do *not* add to [`release-notes.md`](https://github.com/ProperDocs/properdocs/blob/master/docs/about/release-notes.md), this will be written later.

### Submitting changes to the builtin themes

When installed with `i18n` support (`pip install 'properdocs[i18n]'`), ProperDocs allows
themes to support being translated into various languages (referred to as
locales) if they respect [Jinja's i18n extension] by wrapping text placeholders
with `{% trans %}` and `{% endtrans %}` tags.

Each time a translatable text placeholder is added, removed or changed in a
theme template, the theme's Portable Object Template (`pot`) file needs to be
updated by running the `extract_messages` command. To update the
`pot` file for both built-in themes, run these commands:

```bash
(cd packages/properdocs-theme-mkdocs/ && \
pybabel extract --copyright-holder=ProperDocs --msgid-bugs-address='https://github.com/properdocs/properdocs/issues' --no-wrap --version="$(hatch version)" --mapping-file babel.cfg --output-file properdocs_theme_mkdocs/messages.pot properdocs_theme_mkdocs
)
(cd packages/properdocs-theme-readthedocs/ && \
pybabel extract --copyright-holder=ProperDocs --msgid-bugs-address='https://github.com/properdocs/properdocs/issues' --no-wrap --version="$(hatch version)" --mapping-file babel.cfg --output-file properdocs_theme_readthedocs/messages.pot properdocs_theme_readthedocs
)
```

The updated `pot` file should be included in a PR with the updated template.
The updated `pot` file will allow translation contributors to propose the
translations needed for their preferred language. See the guide on [Translating
Themes] for details.

NOTE:
Contributors are not expected to provide translations with their changes to
a theme's templates. However, they are expected to include an updated `pot`
file so that everything is ready for translators to do their job.

### Merging policy

Pull requests should be merged as squash-merge. If a commit description is missing, try to incorporate it from the PR description.

Alternatively, pull requests can be merged as a merge commit, if the PR consists of many clean separate commits.

## Cutting a release

Note: First see additional important information in [`packages/README.md`](https://github.com/ProperDocs/properdocs/blob/master/packages/README.md).

In order to make a release of ProperDocs, do the following:

*   Create a pull request that bumps the version in all [`__init__.py`](https://github.com/ProperDocs/properdocs/blob/master/properdocs/__init__.py) files **and** writes down all user-visible changes since the previous version in [`release-notes.md`](https://github.com/ProperDocs/properdocs/blob/master/docs/about/release-notes.md).

    * Changes specific to themes (if any) need separate headings, because they will go into separate releases. Search for `Version 1.6.7` as an example of this.

*   After squash-merging that pull request, create a tag that exactly corresponds to that version number and push it:
  
    ```bash
    git tag v1.22.333
    git push origin v1.22.333
    ```

*   GitHub Actions will automatically produce a PyPI release for the main package.

    But subpackages need to be released manually, if there were any changes to them. See [`packages/README.md`](https://github.com/ProperDocs/properdocs/blob/master/packages/README.md).

*   Finally, make a release post at [GitHub releases](https://github.com/ProperDocs/properdocs/releases)  - "Draft a new release".

    Select the latest tag, don't enter any title, and copy the release notes into the description.

### Versioning policy

The specific version number in [`__init__.py`](https://github.com/ProperDocs/properdocs/blob/master/properdocs/__init__.py) consists of 3 components in sequence:

* Major - permanently at 1
* Minor - bump for new features and possibly minor breaking changes (breaking changes only if they aren't expected to affect anyone OR there have been sufficient warnings in previous versions.)
* Patch - bump for bugfixes and (rarely) reverts of something in the current minor release.
