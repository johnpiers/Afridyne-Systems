# Contributing

These are the contributing guidelines for the alpm project.

Development takes place at <https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/alpm/alpm>.

## Writing code

This project is written in [Rust] and formatted using the nightly [`rustfmt`] version.

All contributions are linted using [`clippy`] and spell checked using [`codespell`].
The dependencies are linted with [`cargo-deny`] and unused dependencies are detected using [`cargo-machete`].
License identifiers and copyright statements are checked using [`reuse`].
Toml files are formatted via [`taplo-cli`].

Various [`just`] targets are used to run checks and tests.
[`shellcheck`] is used to check the just targets for correctness.
In order to review the snapshot changes in tests, you can use [`cargo-insta`].

Code examples in READMEs is tested via [`tangler`].
Links in markdown files or doc blocks are tested via [`lychee`].

To get all of the necessary tools installed on Arch Linux, run `just install-pacman-dev-packages`.
To setup Rust for this project run `just install-rust-dev-tools`.
Both can also be done in one fell swoop via `just dev-install`.

To aide in development, it is encouraged to configure git to follow this project's guidelines:

```shell
just configure-git
```

This `just` command takes care of a few things:

- Configure `git` to sign commits for this repository using OpenPGP.
- Install the relevant [git pre-commit] and [git pre-push] hooks.
- Install the [git prepare-commit-msg] hook to automatically add a signoff section to the commit message.

## Localization and translations

This project supports localization and translations of its user-facing strings.

### Translation key structure

Translation keys use a hierarchical kebab-case naming scheme that maps the code base structure:

```text
{module}-{group}-{key}
```

- `module` typically mirrors the Rust file that contains the translation usage.
- `group` is optional and highlights that a subset of keys inside a module refers to the same feature.
- `key` pinpoints the specific translation.

### Adding translations

Join our translation efforts at [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/alpm/)!

When adding new translation keys or changing existing ones, follow these rules:

1. Add or change keys only in the English `.ftl` files in `locales/` and commit them here. Weblate will automatically
   pick up new keys after a push.
1. Do not edit non-English translations directly in the repository. Instead, update them via Weblate and a respective
   translation merge request will be created in GitLab.

Also, follow these conventions when adding or updating translation keys:

1. Use lowercase ASCII letters with hyphens as separators. Avoid other punctuation.
1. Keep related keys under a shared `{module}-{group}` prefix to make their relationship obvious.
1. Pick descriptive names that clarify what the text is used for and where it sits within the hierarchy.

Some examples are `error-io-write-archive` and `cli-format-pretty-help`.

## Testing

We run [`nextest`] for fast execution of unit and integration tests.
`just test` calls `cargo nextest` as well as `just test-docs`, which runs the doc tests as `nextest` isn't capable of doing that [yet](https://github.com/nextest-rs/nextest/issues/16).

The `just containerized-integration-tests` recipe executes all tests that are made available by a `_containerized-integration-test` feature and are located in an integration test module named `containerized`.
With the help of a [custom target runner], these tests are executed in a containerized environment using [`podman`].

The `just virtualized-integration-tests` recipe executes all tests that are made available by a `_virtualized-integration-test` feature and are located in an integration test module named `virtualized`.
Different from the `containerized-integration-tests` recipe, this test target concerns itself with tests that are _not_ run in a container, but must be run on bare metal or in a virtual machine.

For parameterized tests, we utilize `rstest`. This is encouraged, but don't go overboard when writing your own tests.
As a rough guideline, if your parameterization results in `if` checks inside the test, consider creating a dedicated test function for that case.

### Code coverage reports

Code coverage for unit tests, doc tests and integration tests is calculated using [`cargo-llvm-cov`].
Each test recipe (e.g. `just test`, `just test-docs`, `just containerized-integration-tests`) can be instructed to generate coverage data.
The payloads (e.g. examples and tests) are compiled while exposing the environment variables set by `cargo-llvm-cov show-env` which results in them including coverage instrumentation.

In a second step, the `just create-coverage-report` command creates a cobertura code coverage report from all existing coverage data in `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/llvm-cov/`, utilizing the [`llvm-tools-preview`] component.
When calling `just create-coverage-report with-docs`, doc tests are considered as well.
However, this is still an [unstable nightly-only feature](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85658) and it always requires to generate coverage data for unit tests (`just test`) and doc tests (`just test-docs`) first.

## Continuous integration

This project's checks and tests are executed in a continuous integration environment based on Arch Linux.

If the `CI` environment variable is set (this is usually the case e.g. in GitLab CI pipelines), our [custom target runner] script will automatically select the Arch Linux GitLab container registry instead of the default container registry to circumvent running into rate limiting.

## Writing specifications

Specifications for technology of this project are written in markdown documents in the context of a [component], that serves as its reference implementation.
The specifications are located in the [component]'s `resources/specification/` directory and must end on `.5.md` or `.7.md`, so that they can be used as [section 5] or [section 7] man pages, respectively.

### Specification versioning

A new specification version must be created, if fields of an existing specification are altered (e.g. a field is removed, added or otherwise changed semantically).

By default, given an example specification named `topic` and given only one version of `topic` exists, there would only be a document named `topic.7.md`.
If the need for version two of `topic` arises, the document is renamed to `topicv1.7.md`, a new file named `topicv2.7.md` is used for the new version and a symlink from the generic specification name to the most recent version (here `topic.7.md -> topicv2.7.md`) is created.
Versioned specifications additionally must clearly state the specification version number they are addressing in the `NAME` and `DESCRIPTION` section of the document.

New (versions of) specifications must be accompanied by examples and code testing those examples.

The examples and code testing those examples must be kept around for legacy and deprecated specifications to guarantee backwards compatibility.

## Writing commit messages

To ensure compatibility and automatic creation of [semantic versioning] compatible releases the commit message style follows [conventional commits].

The commit messages are checked by `just run-pre-push-hook` via the following tools: [`cocogitto`] & [`committed`].

Follow these rules when writing commit messages:

1. The subject line should be capitalized and should not end with a period.

1. The total length of the line should not exceed **72** characters.

1. The commit body should be in the imperative mood.

1. Avoid using the crate name as the commit scope. (e.g. `feat(alpm-types)`)
   The changelog entries will be generated for the associated crate accordingly using [`release-plz`] and [`git-cliff`].

Here is an example of a good commit message:

```text
feat(parser): Enhance error handling in parser

Improve error handling by adding specific error codes and messages
to make debugging easier and more informative. This update enhances
parsing accuracy and provides more context for handling parsing errors.

## Merging changes

Changes to the project are proposed and reviewed using merge requests and merged by the developers of this project using [fast-forward merges].

## Creating releases

Releases are created by the developers of this project using [`release-plz`] by running (per package in the workspace):

```shell
just prepare-release <package>
```

Changed files are added in a pull request towards the default branch.

Once the changes are merged to the default branch a tag is created and pushed for the respective package:

```shell
just release <package>
```

The crate is afterwards automatically published on <https://crates.io> using a pipeline job.
